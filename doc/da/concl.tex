\chapter{Conclusion}
We hope this work provides an easy access to dependent types and the sized type principle.
The pattern matching of \mugda should be more accessible than the traditional fixed-point operator
notation used in a lot of previous presentations of sized types.
We think that the \mugda language demonstrates the usefulness of sized types.
To that end, we have stretched Coquand's simple algorithm to a quite usable system.
\subsubsection{Inference of sizes}
The possibility to infer all size expressions automatically should be explored.
The system $\mathsf{CIC\textasciicircum}$ described in \cite{bgp:lpar06} can handle the inference of size annotations. 

Applying inference to our system would change the system quite a bit.
Size annotations would not be available to the user and the size type would likely loose its first order status. Every data type would internally be represented as a sized type. The termination criterion could be simplified, where the size-change principle has to be only applied to all inferred size arguments.
\subsubsection{Implicit arguments}
At run-time, the size arguments all end up being $\infty$.
Thus, it would be wasteful that this payload is kept around during run-time. 
the removal of ballast that is not needed at run-time is ongoing research (\cite{miquel01implicit,DBLP:conf/types/BradyMM03}).
As lists, vectors and sized list carry the same payload, conversion functions can be written by the user to change from one representation to the other. At run-time, then these conversion routines could be safely removed because it would amount to an identity function.
\subsubsection{More mutual definitions}
We could allow more kinds of mutual definitions.
Defining a $\fun$ together with a $\data$ type amounts to the so called inductive-recursive definitions (\cite{dybjer01indexed}).
Also, mixed inductive/co-inductive definitions would be interesting. We investigated this approach and some adjustment of the admissibility of sizes seems to be necessary to handle such definitions.
\subsubsection{Higher order sub-typing and universes }
The sub-typing relation could be extend to higher order sub-typing.
Polarized sub-typing (\cite{steffen:phd}) could be explored.
The universe hierarchy also often has sub-typing ($ \mathsf{Set_i} \leq \mathsf{Set_{i+1}}$), which has to be integrated with the sub-typing on sized types.
\subsubsection{Future of sized types}
We think it could be worthwhile to integrate a sized type approach into a full system like Agda2, especially with the extension to co-inductive types in mind. Productivity is handled quite naturally with a sized type approach. 
Furthermore, there are plans to translate the full Agda2 to a simpler core language (\cite{mini-tt}), which can be more easily justified. Once again, a sized type approach could be looked at for this core language.
