\chapter{Introduction}
\section {Computer Aided Theorem proving}
Formal proofs with the help of a computer.
\section{Lambda Calculus}

in untyped lambda calculus, there are non-terminating terms, for example the famous \( \Omega \):

\[ \Omega := (\lambda x . x x) (\lambda x . x x) \]


\section{Martin-L\"of Type Theory}
\section {Curry Howard Isomorphism}
The Curry Howard Isomorphism relates theorem proving to functional programming.
\section{Agda}

Agda is a family of theorem proovers from Chalmers Tu.
The current Agda2 version is developed by Ulf Norell.
Agda2 allows general recursive functions to be defined by pattern matching.

\section {Termination checking}
Termination checking is especially important for theorem proving.
One might easily have a proof that looks correct, but is none because the proof seen as a function
via the Curry-Howard isomorpism is non terminating.
A function defined by the equation $ f x = f x $ is a proof for every proposition.
