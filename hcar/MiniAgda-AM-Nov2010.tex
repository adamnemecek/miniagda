MiniAgda is a tiny dependently-typed programming language in the style
of Agda~\cref{agda}. It serves as a laboratory to test potential additions to the
language and type system of Agda. MiniAgda's termination checker is a
fusion of sized types and size-change termination and supports
coinduction. Equality incorporates eta-expansion at record and
singleton types. Function arguments can be declared as static; such
arguments are discarded during equality checking and compilation.

Currently, I am developing a source translation from MiniAgda to
Haskell as prototype for an Agda to Haskell compiler. In the long
run, I plan to evolve MiniAgda into a core language for Agda with
termination certificates.

MiniAgda is available as Haskell source code and compiles with GHC
6.12.x.
