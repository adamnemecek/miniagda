MiniAgda is a tiny dependently-typed programming language in the style
of Agda~\cref{agda}. It serves as a laboratory to test 
potential additions to the
language and type system of Agda. MiniAgda's termination checker is a
fusion of sized types and size-change termination and supports
coinduction. Bounded size quantification and destructor
patterns for a more general handling of coinduction.
Equality incorporates eta-expansion at record and
singleton types. Function arguments can be declared as static; such
arguments are discarded during equality checking and compilation.

MiniAgda is now hosted on \url{http://hub.darcs.net/abel/miniagda}.
 
MiniAgda is available as Haskell source code on hackage and compiles with GHC
6.12.x -- 7.8.2.
